Step-by-Step Guide to Building SocietyApp
1. Project Planning & Feature List
User Roles: Define user types:
Students (can register, join societies, see events)
Society Admins (manage societies, approve members, post announcements/events)
Super Admin (oversees all societies, manages disputes)
Core Features:
User Authentication (JWT-based login/signup)
Society Registration & Management (societies create their pages, accept members)
Announcements & Events (societies post updates, users see on dashboard)
Main Dashboard (aggregated feed of all society and university-wide events)
Chatbot (suggests societies & upcoming events)
Notifications System (event reminders, new posts)
Search & Filter (search societies, events by category)
User Interests System (users select interests, chatbot suggests societies)
2. Set Up Your Development Environment
Frontend: React Vite
sh
Copy
Edit
npm create vite@latest society-app --template react
cd society-app
npm install
Backend: FastAPI
sh
Copy
Edit
mkdir backend
cd backend
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # (or venv\Scripts\activate on Windows)
pip install fastapi[all] uvicorn
Database: PostgreSQL
Use Supabase or direct PostgreSQL
Install SQLAlchemy for ORM in FastAPI:
sh
Copy
Edit
pip install sqlalchemy psycopg2
3. Build the Backend with FastAPI
Authentication System (JWT)
Use OAuth2 + JWT:
sh
Copy
Edit
pip install passlib python-jose
Set up user authentication (auth.py in FastAPI)
Database Models
Create models using SQLAlchemy:

User (id, name, email, password, interests)
Society (id, name, description, category, admin_id)
Event (id, name, society_id, datetime, description)
Membership (id, user_id, society_id, status)
Announcement (id, society_id, content, timestamp)
API Endpoints
POST /register â†’ Register user
POST /login â†’ User login, return JWT
POST /society â†’ Create a new society (admins only)
POST /join-society â†’ Request to join society
GET /dashboard â†’ Get main feed (announcements, events)
GET /society/{id} â†’ Get specific society data
GET /recommendations â†’ Chatbot API for society suggestions
4. Build the Frontend with React Vite
Setup Routing (React Router)
sh
Copy
Edit
npm install react-router-dom axios
Pages
Home â†’ General feed
SocietyPage â†’ Shows events, announcements of a specific society
UserDashboard â†’ Userâ€™s joined societies, upcoming events
Register/Login â†’ User authentication
API Calls with Axios
Example:

js
Copy
Edit
import axios from 'axios';

const fetchDashboard = async () => {
  const res = await axios.get('http://localhost:8000/dashboard', {
    headers: { Authorization: `Bearer ${localStorage.getItem("token")}` }
  });
  return res.data;
};
5. Implement Chatbot with Ollama
Since you're learning Ollama, follow these steps:

Install Ollama:
sh
Copy
Edit
pip install ollama
Create a basic chatbot model:
python
Copy
Edit
from ollama import Chatbot

chatbot = Chatbot("society_bot")

def get_recommendations(user_interests):
    response = chatbot.ask(f"Suggest university societies for a student interested in {user_interests}.")
    return response
Connect chatbot with /recommendations endpoint in FastAPI.
6. Add Additional Features
Event RSVP System â†’ Users can RSVP for events, get reminders
Admin Dashboard for Societies â†’ Create/Manage their events, registrations
Dark Mode Toggle (for better UI experience)
Polls & Surveys â†’ Societies can run votes for event preferences
Gamification â†’ Badges for attending events, active participation
WebSocket Notifications â†’ Real-time updates using FastAPI WebSockets
7. Deployment & Hosting
Frontend: Vercel/Netlify
Backend: Railway/Fly.io or VPS (DigitalOcean, AWS)
Database: Supabase (PostgreSQL managed)
Chatbot Hosting: Dockerize Ollama and run it on a dedicated instance.
8. Future Enhancements
ML-Based Recommendations: Train Ollama to better suggest societies based on engagement
Mobile App: Use React Native for a mobile-friendly version
AI-Powered Notifications: Use Ollama for smart event reminders
Graph-Based UI for Societies: Visual representation of connected societies
